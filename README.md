# Own ChatGPT app with an OpenAI Codex AI model.¬†

## <a href="https://codex-gauravmandall.vercel.app/" target="_blank">Check Website</a>

## Description
This is a chat application where our AI writes code for us using OpenAi text "Davinci 003," code "Cushman 001," and text "Curie 001."

It has two AIs.
  - Sarah: Its accuracy is excellent, the solution is excellent, and it provides better and more optimised answers than John.
  - John: It can solve complex tasks and is much faster than Sarah.

## Technologies Used
  - We used HMR, JSX, CSS, and the frontend for client-side applications.
  - We used the OpenAI API to solve complex tasks and obtain AI-generated solutions for our server-side application.
